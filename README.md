# Speedly
Simple speedometer for iOS, written in Swift.

Initial implementation used two latitude and longitude points to derive speed from distance traversed; since CoreLocation already tracks speed upon polling a location, the former formula was no longer necessary. Remains unfinished due to schooling.

**Previously planned features:**  
1. Setting speed limit using swipe gesture  
2. Animations
